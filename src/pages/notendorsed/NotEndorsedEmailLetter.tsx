        <p>The Honorable [pro - wolf official’s name <br /> U.S. Senate or U.S. House of Representatives or [state Senate or [state House of Representatives or  [state]  Assembly or [state] Governor’s Office</p>
        <p>I am writing to express my heartfelt concern for wolves. Unfortunately, wolves are increasingly facing danger from hunting and trapping policies that aim to reduce their numbers. Without protection, wolves face the harsh reality of being hunted for merely existing.</p>
        <p>When wolves thrive in their natural habitat, all species that rely on a healthy ecosystem benefit. Wolves play a crucial role in regulating prey populations, fostering biodiversity in plant life and habitat recovery, as well as mitigating the potential impact of climate change. That’s why it’s so important to protect them from further harm.</p>
        <p>Please make sure these beautiful creatures stay safe for generations to come. By voicing your support for wolves and voting in favor of wolf protection efforts, you can make a real difference in their future.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
